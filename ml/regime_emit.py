# Zinger ML — Emit a live regime signal consumed by the JS governor.
# Fits the statistical jump model on the latest cached OHLCV and writes the
# current regime label, idio-vol tilt, and enough context for the governor to
# override its heuristic.
#
# Written through the shared SQLite store (data/zinger.db, docs table) under the
# key `regime_signal.json`, matching every other ML script and — crucially — the
# path `loadFileOrStore` reads on the Node side. Writing a bare JSON file here
# left the governor permanently blind on Node 22, where the store is sqlite.
#
# This is the ONLY writer of `regime_signal.json`. Both Node consumers
# (`src/polymarket/regimeSignal.ts` -> the governor overlay and the alpha
# fusion) go dark without it, silently and with green tests — see backlog 38.
#
# Usage: python3 ml/regime_emit.py [LINK/USDT|BTC/USDT|ETH/USDT] [1h|5m]
