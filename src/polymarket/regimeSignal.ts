/**
 * The one owner of the jump-model regime signal.
 *
 * `ml/regime_emit.py` fits a two-state statistical jump model and writes its
 * verdict through the shared store under `regime_signal.json`. Two consumers
 * read it — the governor (profile selection) and the alpha fusion (sizing
 * de-risk) — and they must agree on three things: where it lives, when it is
 * too old to trust, and what its labels mean.
 *
 * They previously did not. The governor read through `loadFileOrStore` (sqlite
 * on Node 22) while the emitter wrote a bare JSON file, so the governor was
 * permanently blind; the fusion read that file directly via `process.cwd()`,
 * ignoring `ZINGER_DATA_DIR`. This module exists so there is one answer.
 *
 * The model is `n_states=2`: it reports high volatility or not. It is not a
 * trend/chop classifier and must not be read as one — see `detectRegimeFromModel`.
